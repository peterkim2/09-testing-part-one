/* Welcome to an intro to testing! This practice module
    will allow you to become familiar with testing concepts.
    We test to check the I/O of our apps. That is - we are not
    checking for HOW something works, but the end RESULT and
    state of a particular place in our application.
*/


/* Below is a basic example of a test "framework" where
    our test is a function that we can reuse to check against
    different components of our application.
    We test for failing functionality first to then refactor
    the test to pass.

    This is common practice in testing ('red-green' refactoring).

Write a test FIRST! Use the `assert()` function below to ensure
